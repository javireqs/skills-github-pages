Hi, my name is Javier Hernandez Requena. I'm a technician by trade, but fell in love with hacking and coding.<br>
I also love music, art, cars, fashion, and all sorts of other things. My wife says I have ADHD because of the way my brain works, but what does she know!?! :P<br>
Anyway, it's nice to have you here! Hope you enjoy my posts! Peace!
